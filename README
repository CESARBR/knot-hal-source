	KNOT HAL for Linux and Arduino


KNOT HAL is part of KNOT project. It aims to provide hardware abstraction
layer for SPI and nRF24L01 radios. Allowing power constrained embedded
devices to join a wireless network and exchange datagrams using nRF24L01
radios.

The initial target platforms are Arduino (nodes), and Raspiberry PI GW.
nRF24L01 is a highly integrated, ultra low power (ULP) 2Mbps RF transceiver
IC for the 2.4GHz ISM band. On a second project phase, other radio access
technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, and Wi-Fi are planned.
