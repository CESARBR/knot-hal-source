Service 	org.cesar.nrf

Adapter hierarchy
=================
Interface 	org.cesar.nrf.Adapter1
Object path 	[variable prefix]/{nrf0, nrf1, ...}

Methods 	void RemoveDevice(object device)

		Removes a remote nRF device including its local stored
		data such as keys, and properties.

		Returns: org.cesar.nrf.Error.InvalidArguments

		This method releases the device scanning session.

		Returns: org.cesar.nrf.Error.NotReady

		eg: 88:77:66:55:44:33:22:11 (MSB on left)


		boolean Powered [readwrite]

		Not persistent property. Switch Switch nRF adapter on/off



Device hierarchy

Object path 	[variable prefix]/{nrf0, nrf1, ...}/dev_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx


Methods 	void Bind(dict properties)

		This method allows to create persistent association. Allowed
		properties: "PublicKey", "PrivateKey". Keys are optional,
		binding without keys results on open physical channel.
